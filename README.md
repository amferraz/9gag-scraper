9gag-scraper
============

A 9gag scraper based on Scrapy

Running
=======

Just cd to `ninegag` directory and execute
    
    ./scrape.sh

It will scrape 9gag until you press CTRL+C. All data collected will be in a 
file named "9gag.csv".

9gag-scraper is built on top of the awesome [Scrapy](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy)

Note: the project is named "ninegag" because Scrapy projects do not support
project names starting with numbers.
